I've been called 'Jen Montes' for almost a decade, but it has never been my real name. My reason for using a pseudonym was pretty simple: when I first looked to buy a URL with my own name, I learned that it was currently being used by fledgeling porn star.

I shouldn't have been surprised that it was taken. According to Social Security records, my first name was the [second most popular girl's name in the 1980s](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names1980s.html) and my surname is the [8th most popular in the United States](http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html) (and 1st among Hispanic surnames).

Clearly, I needed an alternative.

My then-husband was gracious enough to let me borrow his surname, so that's what I've been using since. I even registered 'Jen Montes LLC' so that people could write checks to this 'Jen Montes' without their banks raising a fit. It was *legit*.

Things change though. I haven't been married for about 3 years now, so continuing to use the name feels... odd. I think it's time to move on.

I still can't use my 'real' name though. People have been squatting on that domain [since 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/*/jennifergarcia.com) and it doesn't look like that will change anytime soon. To remedy this, I've decided to go with the nickname I've been using privately for a few years now: cuibonobo.

I'm proud of 'cuibonobo'. It's a (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of *cui bono* and *bonobo*:

- Cui bono (kwee-bow-no) roughly means, “Who benefits?” It's a useful tool for figuring out motive.
- Bonobos are a species of ape closely related to the chimpanzee and best known for living in matriarchal societies and resolving disputes with casual sex.

Fitting, I think.

Starting today, I will join the ranks of the [mononymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononymous_person). Hopefully I can live up to it.
