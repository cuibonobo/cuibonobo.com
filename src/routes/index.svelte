  You may know me as Jen, but on the internet I'm more commonly known as <strong>cuibonobo</strong>.
  (It's a name I
  <a href="https://cuibonobo.com/articles/the-artist-formerly-known-as-jen-montes/">made up</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  This site is still in active development and I've been <a
    href="https://github.com/cuibonobo/cuibonobo.com">using it and building it at the same time</a
  >, but you can learn more <a href="/about/">about me</a>, read some
  <a href="/articles/">things I've written</a>, or check out my
  <a href="/ephemera/">random thoughts</a>.

<p>
  Most of my open-source work is on <a href="https://github.com/cuibonobo">GitHub</a>
  and my most-used social media platform is <a href="https://twitter.com/cuibonobo">Twitter</a>, but
  I've been trying to wean myself off of it lately.
