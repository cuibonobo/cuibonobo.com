    "text": "**Jennifer Garcia** is an artist, engineer, and organizer. Through her work she has [put things in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES_15), drawn characters for [an Emmy-winning show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(2009_TV_series)), and been in the trenches of [struggle for worker power](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/workers-at-atlantas-floyd-county-productions-the-studio-behind-archer-move-to-unionize-202857.html).\n\nFor most of her life she was conflicted about how to apply her talents, but it was through union organizing that she finally found direction.
