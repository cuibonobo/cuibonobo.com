A spool of failed prints are surrounding the printer.](/media/2023/12/2023-12-17-181649_mini-printer.jpeg)\r\n\r\nA few months ago I ordered a [wildly cheap Bluetooth thermal printer from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805006753537.html) and got it to print on [the iOS app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fun.mxw), but I wasn't satisfied with the designs and options on the app and have wanted to create my own prints ever since.\r\n\r\nI've been poking at [NaitLee/Cat-Printer](https://github.com/NaitLee/Cat-Printer) for the past week to try to get it to generate images with [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) instead of having to rely on the web app and I finally got it working!"
