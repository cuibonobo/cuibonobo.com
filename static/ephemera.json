The diagram isn't immediately readable though... It has been Base64 encoded and deflated so that it doesn't take up as much space on the image. You can use [TweakPNG](http://entropymine.com/jason/tweakpng/) to view the `zTxt` section in the PNG and this [draw.io convert tool](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio-tools/tools/convert.html).\r\n"
