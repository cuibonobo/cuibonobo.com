And Calendly doesn't support CalDAV either! For shame."

The diagram isn't immediately readable though... It has been Base64 encoded and deflated so that it doesn't take up as much space on the image. You can use [TweakPNG](http://entropymine.com/jason/tweakpng/) to view the `zTxt` section in the PNG and this [draw.io convert tool](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio-tools/tools/convert.html).\r\n"
