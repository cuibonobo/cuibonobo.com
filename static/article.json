      "text": "Yesterday I logged into an old server that I use for hosting some small applications, a WordPress installation, and other little bits and bobs and I noticed that [`sudo apt-get update`](https://askubuntu.com/questions/222348/what-does-sudo-apt-get-update-do) wasn't working correctly. One of the URLs that the operating system (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) needed to perform updates was suddenly down. _Oh, boy._\n\nI knew in my gut that I couldn't leave this server without an update because I didn't check it often, so it could fall prey to hacks and vulnerabilities when I wasn't looking. I also knew that trying to figure this out would take _at least_ an hour, if not more. Ever since leaving my old systems administrator job in April I haven't touched Linux servers on a daily basis, so I was rusty and that made me even more nervous.\n\nI did eventually fix the update problem and I upgraded my OS to [a more recent LTS version](https://ubuntu.com/blog/what-is-an-ubuntu-lts-release), but that and getting all my apps running again took 2 hours of my Friday evening. Plus, I know this is going to happen again in a few months or a year and I'm going to be even more rusty than I am now. I've been trying to focus more on software development and I just don't have the mental bandwidth to _also_ be a server administrator (a whole career in its own right).\n\nIf I don't want to be a server administrator anymore, I need to get rid of this server.\n\nMost of my new development projects have leveraged [serverless computing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/what-is-serverless/) to solve this \"I don't want to be a server administrator\" problem. Essentially you leave the server administration to a professional and get access to that server via an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). (Technically there is still a server involved in \"serverless computing\" but I only touch it at arm's length, which is what is important here.)\n\nThis website is itself a serverless application, but the only reason it works is that the data for it [lives in the repository alongside the code](https://github.com/cuibonobo/cuibonobo.com). The site takes advantage of the fact that most source code hosting providers have a generous free hosting tier as long as the data is static and public. If you need to host dynamic or private data though, you have fewer options. Solutions like [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv) get you most of the way there, but you will run into issues if you need [relational data](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/relational-databases).\n\nRelational serverless databases that can work on serverless computing platforms are basically the edge of the serverless frontier right now. Products like [CockroachDB Serverless](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/announcing-cockroachdb-serverless/) and [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) allow you to have a serverless database, but the rely on needing a server to run the application that actually uses that data. That is, you can't have both serverless data and serverless computing. [Both](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29004130) [products](https://github.com/planetscale/beta/discussions/32) say they are working on this issue, but there isn't an ETA on when this capability will be available. _Dammit._\n\n---\n\nI thought I was out of luck and would have to administer this server for another few months or longer, but after a bit more digging I discovered that [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is rolling out an \"Early Access\" version of its [Data Platform](https://cloud.prisma.io) product, which allows you to administer a remote database as long as you had the [database connection string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_string). Prisma is basically _running a server for you_ that can serve as the \"glue\" between serverless databases and serverless computing platforms. Sign üëè me üëè up üëè.\n\nOf course, the biggest downside to this scheme is that you need accounts for 3 different things: the serverless database, the serverless application, and Prisma. But, for me, this is a small price to pay compared to remembering Linux commands, keeping up with server updates, and _being responsible for server outages_. Another thing to note is that most of this serverless stuff is \"early access\" or \"beta\", so you need to be willing to put up with some rough edges. I'm extremely patient with troubleshooting new technologies, but I realize that isn't for everyone.\n\nOver the coming weeks I'm going to try setting up a project with a Prisma schema, spinning up a PlanetScale database (which Prisma [seems to support](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/7292)), and getting it all [running on Cloudflare Workers](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-cloudflare-workers). It's possible that by the time I'm done PlanetScale will have a solution that won't require the Prisma Data Platform anymore, but at least I'll have a good story to tell about pushing the boundaries of the serverless data frontier."

      "text": "<video controls loop preload=\"metadata\" src=\"/media/2021/09/git-status-hell.mp4\">\n\tYour browser does not support the HTML5 video tag.\n</video>\n\nI started experiencing really terrible PC performance last Friday and I assumed it was related some network issue at the office because I had commuted to work that day instead of working from home. Unfortunately the bad performance continued on my home network so I decided to investigate further. On the day the bad performance started there had been a Windows Update for \"Security Update for Windows (KB5005260)\", so this was the likely culprit. In the application for uninstalling updates this update appears as \"Servicing Stack 10.0.19041.1161\", but unfortunately the option for uninstalling it is disabled.\n\nI looked around online for some way to disable or uninstall the update and I found [an answer on SuperUser](https://superuser.com/a/1661509/242807) that suggested running the following commands:\n\n```batch\nDISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth\nsfc /scannow\n```\n\nThe first command [attempts to restore the Windows image to a working state](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/repair-a-windows-image) and the second command [attempts to detect corrupt system files](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files-79aa86cb-ca52-166a-92a3-966e85d4094e). I was honestly skeptical that either of them would work but I decided to try it anyway. Before running them a simple command like `git status` would take 8-10 seconds to complete. After running the commands the same command would take less than a second.\n\nI'll definitely reach for this solution first before attempting to brute-uninstall funky Windows updates.",

      "text": "I've been researching serverless architectures because I don't want to get caught in a situation where something happens at 3am and I end up disappointing a bunch of people with my bad server admin skills. There's a bunch of options right now but the one that has my attention is [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) because of their capability of deploying serverless functions \"at the edge\", that is, closest to customers. This might come in handy later when the Internet inevitably fractures into per-country sub-internets that each have their own rules and laws and whatnots.\n\nWhat had been holding me back is that I didn't quite understand the difference between their key-value store, [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv), and a new product called [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects). I think it's a case of unfortunate naming but when Durable Objects came out I asked myself, \"if these are Durable Objects, does that mean data in KV is less durable? Is there some difference in data availability?\"\n\nThese questions sent me down rabbit holes of confusion because nobody was answering them, but today I finally realized that I was completely misunderstanding what Durable Objects are. To fix my confusion, they should have actually been called _Addressable Workers_.\n\nWhen you're running \"normal\" serverless functions, your workers need to be stateless because there could be many different server processes or entirely different machines around the world running your code. Durable Objects turns this idea on its head and instead allows you to register workers that are addressable by a unique ID. As long as your different clients around the world have the same unique ID, they're guaranteed to be talking to the same worker. As a result, this worker can keep parts of its state in memory and your clients will see the same data.\n\nAnother really cool thing about Durable Objects is that you can instantiate a web socket so that clients can send and receive messages from this worker in real time.\n\nNow I can't stop thinking about how to tweak the projects I have in the works to try take advantage of this technology. I'm glad I kept digging instead of stopping at the name.",

      "text": "![An old picture of a crowd of people, altered with an orange halftone](/media/2016/01/drawing-from-the-public-domain.gif)\n\nI'm a staunch advocate for the public domain. It is a deep¬†well of inspiration and influence for most of the cultural objects that humanity produces. Works in the public domain can be consumed, copied, remixed, and performed by anyone, for any purpose, without restriction.\n\nFor most of humanity's history, works needed to be registered in order to be copyrighted, and even then, a copyright would only last a short time. Copyrights grant authors¬†exclusive rights over copies, licenses, and derivatives of their work¬†‚Äî since they create scarcity, they also create wealth and thus they can be valuable properties.</p><p>In the 20th century, copyright terms were¬†[lengthened considerably](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States#Duration_of_copyright)¬†in the United States and works were deemed copyrighted as soon as they were \"fixed in any tangible medium\" ([17 U.S.C. ¬ß 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102)). In other words, works no longer needed to be registered to enjoy copyright protections.\n\nFor individual authors and artists, the copyright extensions and automatic registration are a boon: there are no \"gotchas\" or loopholes with regard to the protection of our work. For¬†*humanity as a whole*¬†though, I'd argue that these changes to copyright law have been detrimental: as a result, most of the cultural output of society has an¬†*owner*.\n\n*Culture*¬†is what gives shape and life to our society. The idea that it is¬†*owned*¬†should give us as much pause as someone claiming to own the air we breathe. Unfortunately, record companies, movie studios, book publishers, and other large entities have a vested interest in keeping copyright law as it is, or even lengthening the terms further.\n\nPerhaps as a response to the current state of copyrighted works, many public and private institutions have taken up the task of digitizing works in their collections that¬†*are*¬†in the public domain so people can easily find them and use them in their own work. Here are a few of the ones I've found most useful:\n\n- [The Commons on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/commons): the depth and breadth of public domain images available on Flickr is truly incredible, and they provide search capabilities by keyword, orientation, color, date, etc. Besides The Commons, Flickr's database of user-uploaded images can also be¬†[searched by license](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/), which widens the pool even more.\n- [New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/research/collections/digital-collections/public-domain): they just released¬†[an excellent visualization tool](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/pd-visualization/)¬†for browsing their collection of 187K public domain images and it is truly a sight to behold.\n- [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/): their Prints & Photographs Catalog is quite extensive and keyword searchable. The thumbnails are pretty small compared to the ones you get on Flickr, but it's still an important resource because of its sheer scale.\n- [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/search): I only recently discovered this one and it suffers from an unintuitive interface and small thumbnails, but it links the resources of many libraries across the United States¬†and allows you to search by time and location.\n\n---\n\nCopyrights are automatic so in many cases works are¬†copyrighted even though¬†*we don't intend them to be*. For this website, I'd like to reverse that position:\n\n> Unless otherwise noted, all work by¬†[cuibonobo](https://cuibonobo.com)¬†created on this website is¬†[dedicated to the public domain](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\nThis means you may copy, modify, distribute, and perform any of the¬†materials you find here without asking for permission.\n\nWith all the benefit that I get from the public domain, it's the least I can do.",
